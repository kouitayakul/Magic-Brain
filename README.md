## Credits:

Thanks to Udemy for providing the full stack web development course. The course allowed me to expand my skillset and improve my understanding in web development. I was able to learn about React and its libraries as well as how to construct a functional server using Express.js and Node.js. I also became experienced with creating queries using SQL and integrating other libraries such as Particle.js and Tilt.js for the user-friendliness of the web app.
